    <h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>

    <p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. It's often expressed using Big O notation, which describes the upper bound of an algorithm's growth rate. An efficient algorithm is one that performs its task in a relatively short amount of time, especially as the input size increases.</p>

    <p>Space complexity refers to the amount of memory an algorithm needs to run to completion. This includes both the input space and the auxiliary space used by the algorithm during its execution. When considering Space Complexity, we often use notations like <b>O(n)</b> to represent the relationship between the memory used and the input size, where 'n' might represent the size of the input data or some other relevant parameter.</p>
