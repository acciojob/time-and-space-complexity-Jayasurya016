	<h1>Time Complexity and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the size of its input. It's a measure of an algorithm's efficiency, indicating how performance scales with increasing input size. Algorithms with lower time complexity are generally preferred because they can handle larger inputs more efficiently</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b>refers to the amount of memory space an algorithm requires to execute, while O(n) (Big O notation) describes the upper bound of that space requirement, indicating that it grows linearly with the input size 'n'. Essentially, if an algorithm's space complexity is O(n), it means the memory it uses increases proportionally to the input data's size.</p>
